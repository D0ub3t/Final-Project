Final Project
Cracking the Code: A Quantitative Study of Mineral Properties
This is an analysis of the database created by Vineeth Venugopal. The dataset, Comprehensive database of Minerals contains a detailed list of minerals and their chemical, physical and optical properties.
This code answers tow significant research questions:
1) How can we use chemical composition and crystal structure to predict Mohâ€™s hardness of a mineral? 
2) What is the relationship between specific gravity and refractive index when compared in various mineral types? 
these questions were answered through statistical analysis using various graphs and statistical tests.
